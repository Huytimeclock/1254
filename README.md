# 1254
1254 is an app that can help you improve ( or not, I dont know, I improved XD ) your flex in learning Hiragana and Katakana
Why I choose to create this 
- Because I cant find any app relate like this.... 

How to install
You need 

- Microsoft Visual Studio 
- SQL Server Management 

*sorry because this app is a project from school and I cant use anything different than SQL, tho I dont know how to make it so you cant use in any kind of simple setup, sorry, maybe u can find this similar app outside there, good luck

1. Create Database by click the JapanDatabase.sql, highlight all of them ( ctrl A then press execute ) remember your server name.

2. Go to :\1254-3-5\1254-1-3\Appdemo1\Appdemo1\1254-app to fix the code
- FormGame -> ctrl H -> replace "Huytimeclock" with your SQL server name
- FormGuild -> ctrl H -> replace "Huytimeclock" with your SQL server name
- FormScore -> ctrl H -> replace "Huytimeclock" with your SQL server name

5. To have all the sound pack, just put 1254note.txt, 1254DB Sound, 1254SongPack to the root of the folder where u setup ( default if u just click and click is C:/ I recommend you to build setup in another Disk like E: D:,... )
6. after install u will have the app to use
